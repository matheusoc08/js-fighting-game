# JS Fighting Game
This project it's a first try 2D fighting game using JavaScript and HTML Canvas. It was coded following the instructions from the Chris Courses' video [JavaScript Fighting Game Tutorial with HTML Canvas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyqbNFMDRGQ).

I'm looking foward to study to keep improving the project, adding a home menu, new characters with different weapons, select character menu, stages and find a way to set up an A.I for a single player mode.
